in the question we have to find the missing number in an array having elemets from 1 to N
so we will find the sum of all elements in an array
then we know that if the numbers are continous we can use formula of ap to find the expected sum which is n(1+n)/2
we put 1 in the formula because the smallest value is 1.
then we return the difference between the numbers which is the missing element
