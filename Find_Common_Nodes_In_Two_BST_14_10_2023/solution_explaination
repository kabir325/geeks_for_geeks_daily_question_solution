So what we are doing in the question is that we create two stacks and two node pointers pointin got indivisual tree nodes
now for the while loop we check the condition of atleast either of the stack to not be empty or either of the pointer to not be null at least
in the first while loop inside the while loop we check of either the pointere are not NULL
which ever pointer is not NULL we will push the node into the stack and traverse on the left branch 
now we have a if condition to check if both the stack are not empty
now we pop the first elements from the stack and check if they are equal if they are equal they are pushes=d inside the vector we will return and we traverse both nodes to right
if they are not equal the smaller nodes we will traverse to the right and will push the bigger node back in the stack
